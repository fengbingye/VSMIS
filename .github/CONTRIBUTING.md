# Raising an Issue

# Submitting a Pull Request

* The ``master`` branch is a snapshot of the latest release.
* Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your pull request whenever needed (if visual changes)
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging
* If adding new feature:
    * Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it
